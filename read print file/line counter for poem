Once you added this code make a new page and call it "mydocument.txt"
Once that is done, copy the poem into the new page.


run the file to see if the counter works, Make sure to look out for the code it self to add a new page just delete it if it does
get added, if does get added that also means something is wrong with the code.
--------------------------------DO NOT COPY ANYTHING IM BETWEEN THESE 2 LINES---------------------------------------------------


This is the file to test out the program
These first few lines will be set
as a group from the rest of the lines.

The New Colossus

BY EMMA LAZARUS
Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, 
With conquering limbs astride from land to land; 
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand 
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame 
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name 
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand 
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command 
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame. 
“Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she 
With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor, 
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, 
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. 
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, 
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”
